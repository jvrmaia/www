        <span class="project-title"><a href="#hook">Research at UFES</a></span> - <span class="project-tagline">Working on computer-supported diagnosis of tuberculosis through Baciloscopy. The following automated procedure is used: (a) acquisition of image stacks taken at different focal depths in various XY slide positions in an automated microscope, (b) images transmission to a cluster, (c) application of deconvolution algorithms to reduce the pointÂ­spread function effect of the light microscope, (d) application of segmentation algorithms for selection of images with bacilli sugestive structures. The result obtained by the automated process is finally presented to the specialist for a definitive diagnosis.</span>
