                    I transform complex business challenges into scalable, high-performance solutions that drive real impact. With over 
                    a decade of hands-on experience building and leading engineering teams in the fintech space, I've become a trusted 
                    leader who bridges the gap between technical excellence and business outcomes. Currently, I lead the Authorization & 
                    Clearing platform at Dock, where I orchestrate critical payment infrastructure that processes millions of transactions 
                    for businesses across Latin America.

                    My expertise spans the full technology spectrum—from architecting cloud-native systems on AWS and Google Cloud to 
                    designing PCI DSS-compliant environments that handle sensitive financial data. I've built data pipelines that power 
                    real-time decision-making, scaled microservices architectures to serve millions of users, and transformed legacy 
                    systems into modern, maintainable platforms. But what truly sets me apart is my passion for people: I've grown teams 
                    from 2 to 12 engineers, mentored countless professionals, and created environments where innovation thrives. I don't 
                    just solve today's problems—I architect solutions that scale for tomorrow's challenges.
